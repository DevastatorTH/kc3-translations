## 
## THE FOLLOWING QUESTS ARE ADVISED NOT TO BE ADDED ON QUESTS.JSON
## It is utterly confusing and too risky so players should check their respective wikis for reference
## At least until we get each of the quests real IDs
## If we put wrong quests on wrong IDs, too late players would have already scrapped their planes
